### 1-1 A Brief Overview of the History of Computers

 <h5><span style="color:red"><u>Abacus</u></span></h5>

* First device know to carry out calculations.
* Invented in Asia.
* Uses a system of sliding beads ina rack for Addition and subtraction.

 <h5><span style="color:red"><u>Pascaline</u></span></h5>

 * Calculation device invented by Blaise Pascal.
 * Calculated sums up to eight figures long.

**Gottfried von Leibniz** 
  
  * Invented a device that was able to add, subtract, multiply and divide. 

**Joseph Jacquard** 

* Discovered that the weaving instructions for his looms could be programmed with cards with holes punched in them.

**Charles Babbage** 

* Designed two calculating machines: the difference engine and analytical engine.
* Difference engine could perform complex operations such as squaring numbers automatically.

First computer-like machine was the Mark I. It was built, in 1944. By IBM and Harvard University Under leadership of **Howard Aiken**.

**FORTRAN** and **COBOL** were two early programming languages.

In 1970, the microprocessor, an entire central processing unit(CPU) on a single chip was invented.

1977, Stephen Wozniak and Steven Jobs designed and built the first Apple computer.

### 1-2 Elements of a Computer System

A computer is an electronic device capable of performing commands. Basic commands are **input**(get data), **output**(display result), **storage**, and **performance of arithmetic** and **logical operations**. Two main components are **Hardware** and **Software**

### 1-2a Hardware

Major hardware 
* central processing unit (CPU)
* main memory (MM)
* input/output devices
* secondary storage

**Input devices** - keyboard, mouse, and secondary storage
**Output devices** - screen, printer, and secondary storage

### Central Processing Unit and Main Memory

**central processing unit** - "brain of a computer
more powerful = faster the computer
Arithmetic and logical operations are carried out inside the CPU

Main memory, or random access memory, is connected directly to the CPU. Programs must be loaded into main memory before executed.
